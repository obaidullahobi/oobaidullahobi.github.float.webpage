  <h2>Alexander the Great</h2>

  <img src="Alexander1.jpg">
   <p>Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek
     month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July
     356 BC, although the exact date is disputed,[8] in Pella, the
     capital of the Kingdom of Macedon.[9] He was the son of the king
     of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter
     of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus.[10] Although Philip had seven or
     eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely
     because she gave birth to Alexander.Several legends surround Alexander's
	 birth and childhood.[12] According to the ancient Greek biographer
	 Plutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip,
	 Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a
	 thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread "far and wide" before dying away.
	 Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream,
	 securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image.[13] Plutarch
	 offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant
	 before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's
	 father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious
	 Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming
	 that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious
     On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea
	 on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general
	 Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses
	 had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis
	 in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of
	 Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth
	 of Alexander.[14] Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly
	 at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception
	In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's
	future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by
	the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania.[15]
	Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play
	the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt
	 When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse,
	which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted, and
	Philip ordered it away. Alexander however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow,
	asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.[12] Plutarch stated that Philip,
	overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring:
	"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you",
	and bought the horse for him.[17] Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning "ox-head".
	Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India. When the animal died (because of old age,
	according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him

				  <p>When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, and considered such
					academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign from his
					stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle
					and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching
					Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of Stageira, which Philip had
					razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or
					pardoning those who were in exile.Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and
					the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many
					of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as
					the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy,
					 morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion
					  for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy,
					  ich Alexander later carried on his campaigns.</p>

		  <img src="Alexander9.jpg">

	<p>At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent.[12] During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named Alexandropolis.[21]

			Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.[22]

			Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest.[23] Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.[24]

			As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.[25]

			After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war.[26] At Corinth, Philip established a "Hellenic Alliance" (modelled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as "Supreme Commander") of this league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.[27][28]</p>

		  <img src="Alexander8.jpg">

			<p>When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice,
				the niece of his general Attalus.[29] The marriage made Alexander's position as heir
			less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while
			Alexander was only half-Macedonian.[30] During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus
			publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.
			At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too
			young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods
			to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander,
			that throwing one of the cups at his head, "You villain," said he, "what, am I then a bastard?"
			 Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good
			 fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot
			 slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him:
			 "See there," said he, "the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned
			 in passing from one seat to another."— Plutarch, describing the feud at Philip's wedding.
			Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I
			of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge
			with the Illyrian king and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few
			years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily
			trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a
			family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.In the following year, the Persian
			satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother,
			Philip Arrhidaeus.[32] Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip
			intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.[32] Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth,
			to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to
			Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to
			 marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.[32] Philip exiled
			 four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring
			 Thessalus to him in chains.</p>

		  <img src="kingdom1.png">
		  <p>In summer 336 BC, while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's
			 brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias.
			 As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of
			 Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles
			 and army at the age of 20.[35][36][37]</p>
				<h2>Consolidation of power</h2>

				<p>Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin,
				the former Amyntas IV, executed.[38] He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis
				killed, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter
				by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the
				murder of Attalus,[38] who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's
				uncle.Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to
				Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may
				have considered him too dangerous to leave alive.[39] Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all
				accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.[35][37][40]
			   News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the
			   Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly.
			   Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards
			   Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and
			   ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander
			   in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued
				south towards the Peloponnese.Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader
				of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned
				the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay
				in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked
				Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight.[42] This reply apparently
				delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said "But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like
				to be Diogenes."[43] At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon ("leader") and, like Philip, was
				appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising</p>

		<h2>Balkan campaign</h2>
		  <img src="king2.jpg">
		  <p>Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC,
			  he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he travelled east into the country
			  of the "Independent Thracians"; and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the
			  Thracian forces manning the heights.[46] The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi,
			  and defeated their army near the Lyginus river[47] (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched
			  for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at
			  night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.[48]
			  News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in
			  open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing
			  the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.[49]
			 While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately
			 headed south.[50] While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance
			 was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities.
			 The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.[50] Alexander then set out on
			 his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent</p>

		<h2>Conquest of the Persian Empire</h2>
		  <img src="king3.jpg">
		  <p>Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000,[50] drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria.[52][f] He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.[50]

				After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea.[53] Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.[54]

				From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city.[55] At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander "undid" the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future "king of Asia".[56] According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword</p>

		<h2>The Levant and Syria</h2>

		  <img src="king5.jpg">
		  <p><strong style="color:red">Further information:</strong> Battle of Issus and Siege of Tyre (332 BC)
		  In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause
		  due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius'
		  significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius
		  at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind
		  his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure.[58]
		  He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom
		  of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia,
		  it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.[59] Alexander proceeded to take
		  possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the Levant.[54] In the following year,
		  332 BC, he was forced to attack Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult siege.
		  [60][61] The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery.[62]</p>
		  <h2>Egypt</h2>
		  <p>Further information: Siege of GazaName of Alexander the Great in Egyptian hieroglyphs
				(written from right to left), c. 330 BC, Egypt. Louvre Museum When Alexander destroyed Tyre,
				 most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However, Alexander met with
				 resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege.
				 When "his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be
				 impossible… this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt".[63] After three
				 unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious
				 shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children
				 were sold into slavery.[64]Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded
				  as a liberator.[65] He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the
				  Libyan desert.[66] Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father,
				  and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with the horns of a ram as a symbol of his
				  divinity.[67] During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria-by-Egypt, which would become the
				  prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death</p>

		  <p>Further information: Battle of Gaugamela
		 Leaving Egypt in 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq)
		 and again defeated Darius, at the Battle of Gaugamela.[69] Darius once more fled the field,
		 and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter
		 between the two. Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamedan), while Alexander
		 captured Babylon</p>
		 <h2>Persia</h2>
		 <p>Further information: Battle of the Persian Gate
		From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury.
		 He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian
		Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed
		the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian
		army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.
		On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days. Alexander
		stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of
		Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate
		 revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes.Even
		 as he watched the city burn, Alexander immediately began to regret his decision. Plutarch
		 claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires, but that the flames had already spread to
		 most of the city. Curtius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning.
		 Plutarch recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes as
		 if it were a live person:Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led
		 against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other
		 respects.</p>

		  <h2>Fall of the Empire and the East</h2>

		  <img src="road2.jpg">
		  <p>Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia.The Persian king no longer controlled
		his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander
		approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor
		as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander.
		Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that,
		while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.The Achaemenid Empire is
		normally considered to have fallen with Darius.Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat
		him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded
		a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria
		Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria
		 (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central
		 Afghanistan), and Scythia.Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329 BC
		 betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.However, when,
		 at some point later, Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army,
		 Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of
		 Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai.
		 After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.</p>

				  <h2>Problems and plots</h2>

				  <img src="road3.jpg">
				  <p>During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court,
				 notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the
				 ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.[88] The Greeks regarded the gesture as the
				 province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost
				 him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.A plot against his
				 life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander.
				 The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged
				 with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts
				 at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus,
				  Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan),
				 in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten
				 the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.Later, in the Central Asian campaign,
				 a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His official
				 historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander,
				 Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely
				 died soon after.[91] It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior
				 to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce
				 proskynesis</p>

				 <h2>Macedon in Alexander's absence</h2>

				 <p>When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general Antipater, an experienced military and
				political leader and part of Philip II's "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon.[51] Alexander's sacking
				of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception was a call to arms
				by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis.
				Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander,
				who chose to pardon them.[93] There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and
				each complained to Alexander about the other.In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and
				prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.[95] Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest,
				 which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire. However, Alexander's constant
				 demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower,
				  greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after
				  the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC)</p>

				  <img src="road4.jpg">
				  <p>Forays into the Indian subcontinent</p>
				  <p>After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in Old Iranian) to
					cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent.
					He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara (a region presently straddling
					eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan), to come to him and submit to his authority.
					Omphis (Indian name Ambhi), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to
					the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the
					Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas
					and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.[97] Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his
					apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at
					his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented
					him with a wardrobe of "Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents
					in gold". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and
					Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied
					their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital
					 city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.On the
					 subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men
					 and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River. After that victory he was sent by Alexander
					 in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped
					 losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were
					 reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed
					 zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with
					 the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable
					 accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was
					 allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in
					 the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC.In the winter of 327/326 BC,
					 Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the
					 Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys.A fierce
					 contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart,
					 but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the
					 strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos.The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of
					 bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius,
					"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its
					buildings to rubble."[99] A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and
					Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and
					captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent
				   After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against King Porus,
				   who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines (Chenab), in what is now the Punjab
					in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC.[100] Alexander was impressed by Porus' bravery, and made
					him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not
					previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis (Beas).[101][102] Choosing a local
					helped him control these lands so distant from Greece.[103] Alexander founded two cities on
					opposite sides of the Hydaspes river, naming one Bucephala, in honour of his horse, who died
					around this </p>

						  <h2>Revolt of the army</h2>
						  <img src="road5.jpg">
						  <p>East of Porus' kingdom, near the Ganges River, were the Nanda Empire of Magadha and
						further east the Gangaridai Empire (of the modern-day Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent).
						Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning,
						Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east.This river
						thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.As for the Macedonians, however,
						their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India.
						For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry
						and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river
						 Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred
						 fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and
						 horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were
						 awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand
						 chariots, and six thousand war elephants.Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march
						 farther, but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men,
						  he said, "longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland".
						  Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the Indus. Along the way his
						  army conquered the Malhi (in modern-day Multan) and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained
						  an injury during the siege.Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern
						  Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore
						  under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult
						  southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC,
						  but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.</p>

						  <h2>Last years in Persia</h2>
						  <img src="alexander5.jpg">
						  <p>Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his
							  absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a
							  gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would
							  send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops
							  misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent
							   away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of
							   Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units After three days, unable to
							   persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army
							   and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly
								begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several
								thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt to craft
								a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass
								 marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of
								 those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his
								 return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in
								 Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them.Alexander admired Cyrus
								  the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's
								  heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to
								  Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of
								   the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.Afterwards, Alexander travelled to Ecbatana
								   to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There, his closest friend and possible
								   lover, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning.Hephaestion's death devastated
									Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon, as well
									as a decree for public mourning.[118] Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new
									campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize
									them, as he died shortly thereafter

						  <h2>Death and succession</h2>
						  <img src="road6.jpg">

						  <p>On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in
							Babylon, at age 32.[121] There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa.[122] He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.[123] In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony.[124] Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.[122]

								Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination,[125] foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,[126] while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.[124][127] The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence,[128] and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,[129] Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer.[127][129] There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.[127]

								The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available.[130] However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander.[131][132][133] In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance.[134] Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause.[134][135] Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.[136]

								Several natural causes (diseases) have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis.[137] Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis.[138] Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus.[139][140] Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health</p>

						  <h2>After death</h2>
						  <img src="road7.jpg">

						  <p>Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket.[141][142] According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest "would be happy and unvanquishable forever".[143] Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.[144]

								While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis.[141][143] His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late Antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.[145] The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great [146] has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege.

								Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.[145]

								The so-called "Alexander Sarcophagus", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331.[147][148] However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.</p>

						  <h2>Division of the empire</h2>
						  <img src="road8.png">

						  <p>Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed.[51] Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death.[149] According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was "tôi kratistôi"—"to the strongest".[124] Another theory is that his successors willfully or erroneously misheard “tôi Kraterôi” — “to Craterus”, the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.[150]

								Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story.[151] Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.[124][149]

								Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.[152]

								Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between "The Successors" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Mesopotamia and Central Asia, Attalid Anatolia, and Antigonid Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.[153]</p>

						  <h2>Will</h2>
						  <img src="road9.jpg">
						<p>Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death.[154] Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.[154] Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.[51]

								Alexander's will called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:

									Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, “to match the greatest of the pyramids of Egypt”[51]
									Erection of great temples in Delos, Delphi, Dodona, Dium, Amphipolis, and a monumental temple to Athena at Troy[51]
									Conquest of Arabia and the entire Mediterranean Basin[51]
									Circumnavigation of Africa[51]
									Development of cities and the “transplant of populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia, in order to bring the largest continent to common unity and to friendship by means of intermarriage and family ties</p>

						  <h2>Generalship</h2>

						  <img src="road11.png">

						  <p>Alexander earned the epithet "the Great" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander. He never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered.[50] This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops.[156] The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate[clarification needed] Persian forces.[157] Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle,[73] in the manner of a Macedonian king.[156]

								In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces[citation needed], perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.[158]

								At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.[158] Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.[159] At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.[158]

								When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.[159] In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers</p>

						  <h2>Physical appearance</h2>

						  <img src="alexander10.jpg">

						  <p>Greek biographer Plutarch (c. 45–120 AD) describes Alexander's appearance as:

								¹ The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. ² For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. ³ Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. 4 Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the Memoirs of Aristoxenus.[160]

							Greek historian Arrian (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' c. 86–160) described Alexander as:

								[T]he strong, handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky.[161][162]

							The semi-legendary Alexander Romance also suggests that Alexander exhibited heterochromia iridum: that one eye was dark and the other light.[163]

							British historian Peter Green provided a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:

								Physically, Alexander was not prepossessing. Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough. His beard was scanty, and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean-shaven. His neck was in some way twisted, so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle. His eyes (one blue, one brown) revealed a dewy, feminine quality. He had a high complexion and a harsh voice.[164]

							Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image.[165] Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros.[166] Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction</p>

						  <h2>Personality</h2>

						  <img src="road10.jpg">
						  <p>Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents. His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.[164] Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him,[168] and Plutarch tells how his ambition "kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years".[169] However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds.[38] Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle.[164] While Alexander worried that his father would leave him "no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world",[170] he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions
								According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,[172] which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions.[164] Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate.[173] He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.[174] This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.[164] His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.[172] He had great self-restraint in "pleasures of the body", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.[175]

								Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.[169][174] However, he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos).[176] He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader.[149][172] His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.[149]

								During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia.[128] His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect.[177] His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world,[128] in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition,[178][179] an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.[180][181]

								He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself.[128] Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus,[182] a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa.[183] He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon.[183] Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform.[88] This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.[184] However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine.[185] Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.

							<div class="footer23">
						  <h2>Personal relationships</h2>

						  <img src="road11.jpg">

						  <p>Alexander married three times: Roxana, daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria,[187][188][189] out of love;[190] and the Persian princesses Stateira II and Parysatis II, the former a daughter of Darius III and latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III, for political reasons.[191][192] He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon by Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.[193][194]

								Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble.[118][164][195] Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander.[118][196] This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months.[128][137]

								Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy.[197] No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where "Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles."[198] Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.[199]

								Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.[164] However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age.[200] Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly,[201] showing great self-control in "pleasures of the body".[175] Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.[202] Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius' mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.[164]</p>
